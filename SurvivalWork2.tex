The next  model  used to identify the statistically significant factors affecting the time between successive renal function tests allows for only the level of renal function for each patient (as measured by their eGFR), and whether that test was analysed using the RenalQ system. In addition, the combination of these two effects has also been incorporated in the model. The regression model for this model yields  the following summary of effects and their statistical significance.
