The provided data file contained  a total of 255,567  renal function test results conducted during the period starting 2 January, 2013 until 31 March, 2016; these tests were  for a total of 92,735 patients. We wish to question the totality of results;  the results from 2013 may be incomplete because we were provided with data that showed very low numbers of results from 2012, and we do not know when the provided data started to incorporate every test being conducted.


For the purposes of evaluating the time until the next RenalQ test is performed on each patient, we removed all patients who were under 18 years old and the pregnant women as these patients were not subjected to analysis via RenalQ. We also removed the patients whose age or sex was not provided. This allows comparison of the patient results for the RenalQ system with those obtained before RenalQ was introduced. 
This leaves 246,824  test records for 87,316   patients.
